#Project Overview
In this project, we predicted student dropout risk using a Decision Tree model. The data was cleaned by encoding categorical features with label and one-hot encoding and filling missing features with zeros. The model used 15 features, including raisedhands, VisitedResources, AnnouncementsView, Discussion, ParentAnsweringSurvey, ParentschoolSatisfaction, and StudentAbsenceDays. After comparing multiple models, the Decision Tree was chosen for its best performance, achieving 75% accuracy and balanced F1-scores across classes. High-risk students were identified as those predicted in Class_0, and a risk score was calculated using the predicted probability for that class. Feature importance analysis revealed that low participation in hands raised, discussions, and resource usage, along with high absence days, were the key factors contributing to dropout risk.
